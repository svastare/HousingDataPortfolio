# 🏡 Housing Data Cleaning Project

This project is part of my Data Analytics portfolio, demonstrating **data cleaning and transformation** skills using SQL. It focuses on preparing raw housing data for analysis by applying industry-standard cleaning techniques.

## 📁 Files
- `Housing Data for Data Cleaning.xlsx` – Raw housing dataset
- `Data Cleaning PortfolioProject.sql` – SQL script that performs all data cleaning operations

## 🧹 Objectives
- Standardize date and text formats
- Correct inconsistent categorical values (e.g., 'Yes', 'Y', etc.)
- Remove duplicate records
- Handle null values
- Split combined fields (e.g., full address into street, city, state)
- Remove special characters (e.g., `#`, `$`, `,`)
- Drop unnecessary columns
- Ensure data types are appropriate for analysis

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Microsoft SQL Server (SSMS)
- Microsoft Excel (for raw data ingestion)

## 🔑 SQL Techniques Demonstrated
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- `ROW_NUMBER()` for de-duplication
- `REPLACE`, `SUBSTRING`, `TRIM` for string cleaning
- `CAST` / `CONVERT` for data type adjustments
- Use of `ISNULL`, `NULLIF`, and conditional updates

## 📊 Output
A fully cleaned and analysis-ready housing dataset that can be used for:
- Real estate market trend analysis
- Housing price predictions
- Neighborhood-based comparisons
